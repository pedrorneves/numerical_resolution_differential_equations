# numerical_resolution_differential_equations

Developed by:
Leonor Jesus,
Mariana Vinhas and
Pedro Neves (BSc Computational Mathematics course project).

It was developed in MATLAB a program which solves specific ordinary differential equations using the Forward Euler’s Method and Range-Kutta’s third-order method.

The program is initiated by running 'menu_inicial.m'.

Program written in Portuguese.
